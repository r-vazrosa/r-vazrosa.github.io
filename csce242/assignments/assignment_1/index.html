        <h1>Bourbon Chicken</h1>
        <p>
            At Bourbon Chicken, we strive to have the best customer experience.
            Not only is all our meat fresh on the day of, but we outsource our 
            chicken from local farmers. We never cheap out when it comes to our
            customers and their satisfaction is key! We even offer refunds if you don't
            like the meal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have been a family ran company since 1923 and have been proud of it. 
            We have grown from 1 to 23 different franchises and we strive to open up more.
            Although we manage many locations, the quality is all the same, top notch. We
            also offer our workers top of the line benefits other restaurants do not offer.
        </p>
